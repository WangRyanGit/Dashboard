<p>The following ActiveVPN Software License and Terms of Service Agreement ("Terms" or the "Agreement") for the ActiveVPN Software and Service is a legal contract between you, an individual subscriber ("You"), and ActiveVPN, Inc. if you are a resident or citizen of the United States of America, or between You and ActiveVPN(together with ActiveVPN, Inc., "ActiveVPN"), if you are not a resident or citizen of the United States of America, regarding your use of the ActiveVPN Software to create a virtual private network ("VPN") connection (the "Service").</p>
<p>PLEASE READ CAREFULLY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT. BY CLICKING THE "INSTALL" BUTTON TO INITIATE THE INSTALLATION OF THE ACTIVEVPN SOFTWARE, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU ARE ACCEPTING A BENEFIT BY USING THE SERVICE, AND THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT INCLUDING THE REQUIREMENT OF BINDING ARBITRATION FOR ALL LEGAL DISPUTES. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT, CLICK THE "I DECLINE" BUTTON AND THE ACTIVEVPN SOFTWARE WILL NOT BE INSTALLED ON YOUR DEVICE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS, YOU MUST DESTROY, RETURN OR DELETE ALL COPIES OF THE ACTIVEVPN SOFTWARE IN YOUR POSSESSION.
THE SERVICE IS NOT AVAILABLE TO PERSONS UNDER THE AGE OF 18 OR TO ANY USERS PREVIOUSLY SUSPENDED, TERMINATED OR REMOVED FROM THE SERVICE BY ACTIVEVPN.
By clicking the "Install" button or by otherwise registering for, accessing or using the Service, you represent that you are at least 18 years of age and have not been previously suspended or removed from the Service by ActiveVPN.</p>
<p><span>1. The Service.</span> ActiveVPN provides the Service as a means of protecting your privacy by establishing a secure Virtual Private Network ("VPN") connection when connecting to the Internet through unsecured networks or browsing unsecured websites. The Service's VPN utilizes a proxy Internet Protocol ("IP") address (a "Proxy IP Address").</p>
<p><span>1.1 Free and Subscription Service.</span> You may choose whether to use the free Service or the subscription-based Service (the "Elite Service"). If You choose to use the free Service, ActiveVPN may deliver third-party advertisements ("Advertisements"). If You choose to use the Elite Service, ActiveVPN will not deliver any Advertisements.</p>
<p><span>1.2 Traffic Protection.</span> The Service was developed to provide protection against hacking and other potential privacy vulnerabilities when surfing the Internet on an unsecure network, or browsing the Internet by creating a VPN that encrypts traffic to and from your Device, as defined in Section 6.1, and utilizing a Proxy IP Address provided by ActiveVPN. However, software is not perfect and due to defects, bugs, or other reasons, or for no reason at all, ActiveVPN does not guarantee that the Service will create a VPN or utilize a Proxy IP Address on all websites.</p>
<p><span>2. ActiveVPN Privacy Notice.</span>Your privacy is important to ActiveVPN. ActiveVPN Privacy Notice is hereby incorporated into these Terms by reference. Please read this notice carefully for information relating to the ActiveVPN's collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information.</p>
<p><span>3. Modification of these Terms. </span>ActiveVPN reserves the right, at our discretion, to make non-material changes to these Terms at any time. Please check these Terms and any Guidelines periodically for changes. In the event that a change to these Terms materially modifies your rights or obligations, we will make reasonable efforts to notify you at least 30 days in advance of the effective date of such change. We may provide notice through a pop-up or banner within the Service, by sending an email to any address you may have used to pay for ActiveVPN Elite, or through other reasonable means. If you do not agree to the changed Terms you must discontinue your use of the Service. If you are a user of ActiveVPN Elite and you elect to discontinue use of the Service due to a material change in these Terms, we will provide you with a refund as described in Section 9 below. All other changes are effective upon publication of the changed Terms.</p>

<p>The ActiveVPN Elite Service monthly/annual fee, explained here, is paid in advance for the month(s)/year(s) following each recurring charge and is non-refundable except as expressly set forth in these Terms. Taxes may apply on the membership fee.</p>
<p>If the payment mechanism (such as a credit card) we have on file for You is declined for payment of your Elite Service membership fee, we may retry the payment mechanism at the same or lower rate. If all retries are declined, your Elite Service membership will be canceled. If You provide us with a new form of payment and are successfully charged within 30 days, your new Elite Service membership period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge. If your Elite Service is terminated, you may be entitled to a refund, subject to limitations provided in Section 9 of these Terms.</p>
<p>UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US BEFORE A CHARGE THAT YOU WANT TO CANCEL OR DO NOT WANT TO AUTO RENEW, YOU UNDERSTAND YOUR ELITE SERVICE MEMBERSHIP WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONTINUE INDEFINITELY AND YOU AUTHORIZE US (WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW) TO COLLECT THE THEN-APPLICABLE ELITE SERVICE MEMBERSHIP FEE AND ANY TAXES, USING ANY CREDIT CARD WE HAVE ON RECORD FOR YOU.</p>

<p><span>6.4 Automatic Uploading, Routing and Caching. </span>The Services improve your use of the Internet, among other means by enabling your device to load portions of data from other ActiveVPN users and by re-routing some of your requests through other ActiveVPN users or ActiveVPN resources (the "Value Exchange"). Your use of the Services will in turn enable other users to access portions of data from your device and to be re-routed through your device, thereby improving the Internet for other ActiveVPN users. By using the Services you consent to the use of your device in the described manner and agree that other ActiveVPN users may use your network connection and resources in return for your potential use of other users' resources for your own use. Note that ActiveVPN will make its best effort not to enable any use of your device's resources unless your resources are idle at that time, and to maintain the highest levels of privacy and security. ActiveVPN may also cache information you have accessed on your hard drive for future use. If you purchased a Premium account, portions of this section may not be applicable to you. You represent that your entry into this Agreement and your use of the Services does not breach any contract, duty, law, regulation or right, and that if sharing your resources is not desirable or allowed in your case, you will not use the Services, or purchase a Premium account to use the network but not to contribute resources to it.</p>

Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms or the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the termination of these Terms.

<p><span>15.2 Notwithstanding </span>subsection 15.1, we both agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration, or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>
<p><span>15.3 Arbitrator. </span>Any arbitration between You and ActiveVPN will be governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by these Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting ActiveVPN.</p>
<p><span>15.4 Notice; Process. </span>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express (signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical address on file for You, by electronic mail ("Notice"). For United States citizens and residents, ActiveVPN's address for Notice is: ActiveVPN, Inc., PO Box 60429, Sunnyvale, CA 94088. For all other persons, ActiveVPN's address for Notice is: ActiveVPN GmbH, Hansmatt 32, 6370 Stans, Switzerland. The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). We agree to use good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, You or ActiveVPN may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by You or ActiveVPN shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any; provided that if our dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, ActiveVPN shall pay you the greater of (i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any, or (ii) the greatest amount offered by ActiveVPN in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator's award, whichever is greater.</p>
<p><span>15.5 Fees.</span>In the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms, ActiveVPN will reimburse You for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Santa Clara County, California for United States citizens and residents, and at a location to be agreed upon in Switzerland for all other persons, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less, You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a non-appearance based telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in the United States Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, You agree to reimburse ActiveVPN for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator's ruling on the merits.</p>
<p><span>15.6 No class actions. </span>YOU AND ACTIVEVPN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both You and ActiveVPN agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>

<p><span>16.5 Severability. </span>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated from this Agreement to the minimum extent necessary and will not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
<p><span>16.6 Assignment. </span>This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by You, but may be assigned by ActiveVPN without restriction. Any assignment attempted to be made in violation of this Agreement shall be void.</p>
<p><span>16.7 Survival.</span>Upon termination of this Agreement, any provision which, by its nature or express terms should survive, will survive such termination or expiration, including, but not limited to, Sections 5.2, 6.1, and 7 through 16.</p>

<p><span>16.10 Time Limit for Claims. </span>YOU AND ACTIVEVPN AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICE OR SOFTWARE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>
